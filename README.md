# Skew-Correction
Developed a computer vision solution to detect and correct skewed meter images for accurate reading and analysis., Utilized OpenCV for image preprocessing, edge detection, contour analysis, and skew angle estimation., Applied techniques like grayscale conversion, thresholding, and Hough Line Transform for skew correction.
